MY FIRST PROJECT ON GITHUB!
The movie ticket reservation is a software program that helps the user to reserve tickets for a movies. 
It  satisfies the user requirement by including features that makes the reservation process easier and clearer.
The booking process is transparent and direct. Soon after the user gives the details, they are taken to the page to choose the movie, the seats and the multiplex they want. 
This program stores the information of the user securely in the mysql database for future uses
